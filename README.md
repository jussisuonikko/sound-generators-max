# sound-generators-max
Generative Soundscape System developed in Max/MSP as part of a Master’s thesis at Tampere University. Includes two autonomous generators: a sample-based bird soundscape (Try Whistling This!) and a synthesis-based system using the Collatz conjecture for pitch generation. Combines deterministic and stochastic processes.
