# Try Whistling This!

Try Whistling This! is an autonomous sample-based sound generator developed in Max/MSP.  
It creates an evolving ambient soundscape by triggering and processing short bird song recordings using stochastic processes.

Playback timing, sample selection, pitch variation, and stereo placement are randomized to produce a continuously changing texture.

## Requirements

- Cycling ’74 Max (tested with Max 9.x)

## Sound samples

The demo bird recordings are included in this folder.

**Important:** The audio files must be located in the **same folder** as `Try whistling this.maxpat` for the patch to find them correctly.

You may replace the demo samples with your own recordings, but the filenames must match those expected by the patch.


## Running the patch

1. Open `Try whistling this.maxpat` in Max.
2. Turn audio on in Max (enable DSP).
3. Start the generator using the main toggle.

## Demo
